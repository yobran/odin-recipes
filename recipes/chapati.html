    <h1>Chapati</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chapati is a type of unleavened flatbread that is a staple in East African cuisine.</p>
    <p>It is made from simple ingredients and cooked on a hot griddle, resulting in a soft and slightly chewy texture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water and oil, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 6-8 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each chapati for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown spots appear.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and keep warm. Serve hot with your favorite dishes.</li>
    </ol>
